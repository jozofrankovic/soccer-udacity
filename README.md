## Introduction

For this project, I will investigate the European Soccer Database from Kaggle which contains seven tables: "Country", "League", "Match", "Player", "Player_Attributes", "Team", and "Team_Attributes". This dataset covers 11 of the top European leagues from 2008 to 2016. As a lifelong football tragic, it was an easy choice to select this dataset for investigation.

The key questions that I would like to answer include:

Home fortress?: Does a home advantage exist, and if so, which league has the strongest such advantage?
Who are the goal machines and goal leakers?: Who are the best and worst performing home and away teams?
Who runs North London?: Which team in North London has achieved the most wins?
Speedy gonzales: Is pace a factor in a player's overall rating?
